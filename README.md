## About

This is a simple time tracking web application that allows users to create activities and define goals for each activity.
Users can view and retroactively modify their record history, explore their progress for each defined goal and view statistics data for a given time period.

### Motivation

This is a personal project inspired by a mobile time-tracking app. The goal was to create a web app that captures the simplicity and functionality provided by the mobile app, but also provide some new features and make it accessible to all devices through a web browser.
